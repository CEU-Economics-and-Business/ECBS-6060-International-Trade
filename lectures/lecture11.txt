= Lecture 12: The Melitz model =
== The Melitz model ==
* We first describe the equilibrium of a closed economy.
* We then turn to the open economy.
* We conduct two comparative statics:
    * autarky vs open economy
    * change in trade costs

== The basics of the model ==
* Firms differ in their productivity.
* There are fixed costs of exporting.
...
* Such a model is ''qualitatively'' consistent with the two mentioned facts:
    * Fixed costs prevent many firms from exporting.
    * More productive firms are bigger, and bigger firms can recover the fixed cost more easily $\to$ they are more likely to export.

% affine profit functions figure here

== Strict sorting property ==
* There is a ''strict sorting'' property:
    * all firms below a cutoff are non-exporters
    * all firms above that cutoff are exporters

% If you spend some more time describing the logic in the Melitz model, you will naturally get to strict sorting.

== Key implications ==
In the event of a trade liberalization (falling trade costs),
1. more firms will export ("extensive margin"),
2. labor is reallocated from less productive non-exporters to more productive exporters,
3. and least productive non-exporters will exit. 

== Consumers ==
* Consumers have a CES demand structure:
\[
U=\left[ \int_{\Omega }\left( y\left( \omega \right) \right) ^{\rho
}d\omega \right] ^{1/\rho }
\]
with $\rho\in(0,1)$. 
    * elasticity of substitution: $\theta=1/(1-\rho)$
    * set of varieties: $\Omega$ (continuum)
* Demand for good $\omega$:
\[
q(\omega) = Q\left[\frac{p(\omega)}{P}\right]^{-\theta},
\]
where 
\[
 P=\left[ \int_{\Omega } p\left( \omega \right) 
^{1-\theta }d\omega \right] ^{\frac{1}{1-\theta }}.
\]

== Firms ==
* There is a continuum of firms, indexed by $\omega\in \Omega$.
* They produce differentiated products and compete monopolistically.
* Firms differ in productivity $\varphi(\omega)$.

== Technology ==
* Each unit of good $\omega$ requires $1/\varphi(\omega)$ units of labor.
* There is a fixed cost of production, $f$.
\[
l(\omega) = \frac{y(\omega)}{\varphi(\omega)} + f
\]
    * overhead costs of marketing, management, distribution etc.    

== Pricing and demand ==
* Because demand is isoelastic, firms charge a constant markup $1/\rho$,
\[
p(\omega) = \frac{w}{\rho \varphi(\omega)}.
\]
    * More productive firms have lower prices.
* We normalize the wage rate to 1.
* Revenue of firm $\omega$ is
\[
r(\omega) = R\left[\frac{p(\omega)}{P}\right]^{1-\theta} = R\frac{\varphi(\omega)^{\theta-1}}{\int_{\Omega }\varphi\left( \omega \right) 
^{\theta-1}d\omega}
\] 
    * More productive firms have higher revenue.

== Profits ==
* A constant $1-\rho$ fraction of revenue is retained as ''operating'' profits:
\[
\pi(\omega) = (1-\rho)r(\omega)-f = (1-\rho)R\frac{\varphi(\omega)^{\theta-1}}{\int_{\Omega }\varphi\left( \omega \right) 
^{\theta -1}d\omega} -f.
\] 


== Aggregation ==
* The aggregate price index:
\[
 P=\left[ \int_{\Omega } p\left( \omega \right) 
^{1-\theta }d\omega \right] ^{\frac{1}{1-\theta }}.
\]
* Substituting in $p(\omega) = 1/(\rho \varphi)$:
\[
 P=\frac{1}{\rho}\left[ \int_{\Omega } \varphi\left( \omega \right) 
^{\theta-1}d\omega \right] ^{\frac{1}{1-\theta}}.
\]
* Since each firm is fully characterized by $\varphi$, let us do a change of variables:
\[
 P=\frac{1}{\rho}\left[ \int_{\Omega } \varphi^{\theta-1}M\mu(\varphi)d \varphi \right] ^{\frac{1}{1-\theta}}.
\]
    * $M$: number ("mass") of firms
    * $\mu(\varphi)$: fraction of firms with productivity $\varphi$



== Average productivity ==
* Introduce a ''geometric average'' of productivities,
\[
 \tilde\varphi=\left[ \int_{\Omega } \varphi^{\theta-1}\mu(\varphi)d \varphi \right] ^{\frac{1}{\theta-1}}.
\]
* Clearly,
\[
 P = \frac{1}{\rho\tilde \varphi}M^{1/(1-\theta)} .
\]
* In fact, $\tilde \varphi$ completely summarizes the productivity distribution of firms.
* All aggregate variables are as if the economy were populated by 
    * $M$ ''identical'' firms
    * with productivity $\tilde\varphi$


== Average profits ==
* Recall
\[
\pi(\tilde\varphi) = (1-\rho)r(\tilde\varphi)-f.
\]
* Aggregate revenue is $R$:
\[
 R = Mr(\tilde\varphi) .
\]
* So the profit of the average firm is
\[
\pi(\tilde\varphi) = \frac{(1-\rho)R}{M}-f.
\]



== Firm-level variables ==
* Firm-level variables depend on $\varphi/\tilde\varphi$.
* Revenue of firm $\varphi$ is
\[
r(\varphi) = r(\tilde\varphi)\left(\frac{\varphi}{\tilde\varphi}\right)^{\theta-1}
\] 
* Profits:
\[
\pi(\varphi) = (1-\rho)r(\tilde\varphi)\left(\frac{\varphi}{\tilde\varphi}\right)^{\theta-1} - f
\] 
* All else equal, if the average firm (the competition) is better, firm $i$ makes less revenue and less profits.


== Firm entry ==
* Before entering, the firm doesn't know its true productivity. (Otherwise only the best firms would enter.)
* (Everything we say about productivity can be understood as "product appeal". Why?)
* They pay a fixed cost, $f_e$.
    * setting up a plant
    * hiring workers
    * producing the first prototype
* After entry, they draw a productivity from a continuous distribution $G(\varphi)$.
* Clearly, if $\pi(\varphi)<0$ (remember the overhead costs), the firm exits right away.

== Zero-profit cutoff ==
* There exists a cutoff probability below which firms make negative profit:
\[
 \varphi^*:  \frac{(1-\rho)R}{M}\left(\frac{\varphi^*}{\tilde\varphi}\right)^{\theta-1} - f =0
\]
* This clearly depends on average productivity, $\tilde\varphi$.
    * Higher $\tilde\varphi$ reduces the profit of each firm.
    * Even more productive firms cannot recover their fixed cost.
    * $\varphi^*$ rises.

== Average productivity ==
* Average productivity depends on the distribution of firms.
* Firms below $\varphi^*$ exit right away, $\mu(\varphi)=0$ for all $\varphi<\varphi^*$.
* Firms above $\varphi^*$ are drawn from a ''truncated distribution'':
\[
 \mu(\varphi) = \frac{g(\varphi)}{1-G(\varphi^*)}
\]
* Substitute into average productivity:
\[
 \tilde\varphi=\left[ \int_{\Omega } \varphi^{\theta-1}\mu(\varphi)d \varphi \right] ^{\frac{1}{\theta-1}}.
\]

== Expected profit ==
* The expected profit of a new entrant is
\[
 G(\varphi^*)\cdot 0 + (1-G(\varphi^*))\cdot \pi(\tilde\varphi).
\]
* If there is free entry, this should equal the entry cost:
\[
 (1-G(\varphi^*))\pi(\tilde\varphi) = f_e.
\]
\[
 (1-G(\varphi^*))\left[\frac{(1-\rho)R}{M}-f\right]= f_e.
\]


== Equilibrium ==
* In equlibrium, both the zero-profit-cutoff and the free-entry conditions hold.
* We also have labor market clearing.
* Because ''in expectation'' firms make zero profit,
\[
 L = R.
\]
* This pins down the ''number of firms'', $M$.


==  ==
\widefigure{melitz1}{Equilibrium production cutoff}


== Pareto example ==
* Suppose the distribution of firms is Pareto:
\[
G(\varphi) = 1-\left(\frac{\varphi}{\varphi_\min}\right)^{-k}.
\]
* Then $\varphi^{\theta-1}$ is also pareto with exponent $K=k/(\theta-1)$.
* The Pareto distribution has a simple truncated mean
\[
\tilde\varphi^{\theta-1} = \frac{K}{K-1}\varphi_*^{\theta-1}
\]
* This simplifies many of the formulas.


== Pareto example ==
* Zero-profit cutoff:
\[
 \frac{(1-\rho)R}{M}\frac{K-1}{K} - f =0,
\]
so that
\[
 \frac{(1-\rho)R}{M} =\frac{K}{K-1} f.
\]
* Free entry:
\[
 \left(\frac{\varphi^*}{\varphi_\min}\right)^{-k}\left[\frac{(1-\rho)R}{M}-f\right]
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\varphi^*}{\varphi_\min}\right)^{-k}\frac{1}{K-1} f= f_e.
\]



= The open economy =
== The open economy ==
* We take a small open economy with trade costs $\tau$.
* (We would have similar conclusions with GE of large economies.)
* Opening up to trade basically amounts to increasing the size of the market.

== Foreign demand ==
* Foreign demand is a similarly isoelastic,
\[
q_x(\varphi)=A p_x(\varphi)^{-\theta}.
\]
* Because we are in a small open economy, we treat $A$ as a ''constant'' demand shifter.
* (It would move around in GE.)


== Exports vs domestic sales ==
* Exporting has a marginal, "iceberg" cost $\tau>1$.
    * This includes tariffs as well as transportation costs.
* We can conduct comparative statics wrt $\tau$.

== Export pricing ==
* Foreigners have to pay the shipping cost,
\[
p_x(\varphi) = \frac{\tau}{\rho \varphi},
\]
(again, wage is normalized to 1).
* Foreign price depends on $\tau$.


== Revenues ==
* Foreign revenues are
\begin{align*}
r_x(\varphi) &=  A \rho^{\theta-1} \tau^{-\theta}\varphi^{\theta-1}
\end{align*}
    * More productive firms are bigger both at home and abroad.
    * Foreign revenue decreases in $\tau$.
* Total revenue of an exporter:
\[
r(\varphi) = r_x(\varphi)+r_d(\varphi) = 
\varphi^{\theta-1}\left[A \rho^{\theta-1} \tau^{-\theta} + \frac{R_d}{M}\tilde\varphi^{1-\theta}\right]
\]
    * Total revenue is proportional to $\varphi^{\theta-1}$, just like before.
    * In fact, export / domestic sales is constant across all exporters.

== The decision to export ==
* To send any positive exports, a firm also has to pay a fixed cost $f_x$.
    * setting up distribution networks
    * conforming to regulation
    * catering to foreign tastes
* This can deter some firms from exporting.
* To proceed step by step, we first assume $f_x=0$ so that everybody exports.





= Everybody exports =


== Profits ==
* Recall that operating profits are $(1-\rho)$ fraction of revenue:
\[
\pi(\varphi) = (1-\rho)r(\varphi) = (1-\rho)\varphi^{\theta-1}\left[A \rho^{\theta-1} \tau^{-\theta} + \frac{R_d}{M}\tilde\varphi^{1-\theta}\right] - f
\]
* Importantly,
\[
\frac{\pi(\varphi)+f}{\pi(\varphi')+f} = \left(\frac{\varphi}{\varphi'}\right)^{\theta-1}
\]
for any $\varphi$ and $\varphi'$ so that
\[
\pi(\varphi) = [\pi(\varphi')+f]\left(\frac{\varphi}{\varphi'}\right)^{\theta-1} -f.
\]
* Using this relationship for the ''representative firm'' ($\tilde\varphi$), we can write down
    1. the zero-profit cutoff
    2. and the free entry condition.

== Zero-profit cutoff ==
* The firm at the margin makes zero profit:
\[
0= \pi(\varphi^*) = [\pi(\tilde\varphi)+f]\left(\frac{\varphi^*}{\tilde\varphi}\right)^{\theta-1} -f.
\]
* Average profit:
\[
\pi(\tilde\varphi) = f\left[\left(\frac{\varphi^*}{\tilde\varphi}\right)^{1-\theta}-1\right]
\]


== Expressing average productivity ==
* Again, average productivity depends on the cutoff:
\[
\tilde\varphi = \tilde\varphi(\varphi^*).
\]
    * This function only depends on the distribution of $\varphi$, $G()$.
    * For the ''Pareto distribution'', it is 
    \[
    \tilde\varphi(\varphi^*) = k \varphi^*
    \]
    where $k>1$ is related to the shape parameter of the distribution.

== Zero-profit cutoff ==
* Under the Pareto distribution, average profit is independent of the cutoff:
\[
\pi(\tilde\varphi) = [k^{\theta-1}-1]f.
\]
* This is in fact the same equation as under closed economy.
* (This latter would also hold for other distributions.)



== Free entry ==
* Free entry equates ''expected profits'' with entry costs:
\[
 [1-G(\varphi^*)]\pi(\tilde\varphi) = f_e.
\]
* Or, writing in average profits from the ZCF:
\[
 [1-G(\varphi^*)][k^{\theta-1}-1]f = f_e.
\]
* This pins down $\varphi^*$.
* This is the same $\varphi^*$ as before.


== Labor demand ==
* Given zero profits (in expectation), wages still equal revenue
\[
 L = R_d + R_x.
\]
* Total revenue is also the same as before.
* Because average profits are the same, so are average revenues.
* But then the number of firms, $M$, is also the same.
* Nothing changed. Why?





= Fixed cost of exporting =

== Fixed cost of exporting ==
* To send any positive exports, a firm also has to pay a fixed cost $f_x$.
    * setting up distribution networks
    * conforming to regulation
    * catering to foreign tastes

== Fixed cost of exporting ==
* Now only some firms export.
* These are not a random selection: they are the better ones.
* There is a ''strict sorting'' property:
    * all firms below a cutoff are non-exporters
    * all firms above that cutoff are exporters
* Importantly, 
\[
\frac{\pi(\varphi)+f}{\pi(\varphi')+f} = \left(\frac{\varphi}{\varphi'}\right)^{\theta-1}
\]
no longer holds.

== Exporters vs nonexporters ==
* Revenue:
\[
 r(\varphi) = \begin{cases}
               r_d(\varphi) & \text{if not an exporter}\\
        r_d(\varphi)+r_x(\varphi) & \text{if an exporter}
              \end{cases}
\]
* Employment:
\[
 l(\varphi) = \begin{cases}
               \rho r_d(\varphi) & \text{if not an exporter}\\
        \rho[r_d(\varphi)+r_x(\varphi)] & \text{if an exporter}
              \end{cases}
\]
* Exporters are bigger in both respect (reallocation!).



== The decision to export ==
* A firm with productivity $\varphi$ exports if export profits exceed fixed costs,
\[
(1-\rho)r_x(\varphi)=A \rho^{\theta-1} \tau^{-\theta}\varphi^{\theta-1}\geq
f_x.
\]
* Firms above a threshold $\varphi^*_x$ will export, others will not.



== Aggregation ==
* $\tilde\varphi_x$ is the average productivity of ''exporters'':
\[
 \tilde{\varphi}_{x}=\left[ \frac{1}{M_{x}}\int_{\Omega _{x}}\left( \varphi
\left( \omega \right) \right) ^{\theta -1}d\omega \right] ^{\frac{1}{\theta
-1}}
\]
* Relative export sales:
\[
\frac{r_x(\varphi)}{r_x(\tilde\varphi_x)} = \left(\frac{\varphi}{\tilde\varphi_x}\right)^{\theta-1}
\]
* This implies for ''export profits'' (but not for total profits)
\[
\frac{\pi_x(\varphi)+f_x}{\pi_x(\tilde\varphi_x)+f_x} = \left(\frac{\varphi}{\tilde\varphi_x}\right)^{\theta-1}
\]


== Zero-profit cutoffs ==
* Now we have two zero-profit cutoffs: one for operation, one for exports.
\begin{align*}
\pi(\varphi^*) = \pi_d(\varphi^*) &= 0\\
\pi_x(\varphi^*_x) &= 0
\end{align*}
* (The first equation follows from the fact the the smallest firm does not export.)
* Using the previous methods, these pin down average export and domestic profits:
\begin{align*}
\pi_d(\tilde \varphi) &= [k^{\theta-1}-1]f,\\
\pi_x(\tilde \varphi) &= [k^{\theta-1}-1]f_x.
\end{align*}
* Up till now, profits from the two markets could be treated more or less independent from one another.
* However, not all firms receive $\pi_x$.


== Free entry ==
* Ex ante expected profit is now the sum of two terms:
\[
E(\pi) = E(\pi_d) + E(\pi_x) = [1-G(\varphi^*)]\pi_d(\tilde\varphi) 
+[1-G(\varphi^*_x)]\pi_x(\tilde\varphi_x)
\]
* This has to equal entry costs, $f_e$.
* Or, writing in average profits from the ZCF:
\[
[k^{\theta-1}-1]\left\{[1-G(\varphi^*)]f 
+[1-G(\varphi^*_x)]f_x\right\} = f_e.
\]
* This now pins down a ''combination'' of $\varphi^*$ and $\varphi^*_x$.

== Export and exit ==
* Lower $\varphi^*_x$ implies higher $\varphi^*$.
* If more firms export, this is because export profits are greater.
* This encourages more new firms to enter the industry.
* The least productive firms cannot compete with these new entrants and hence they exit.


== Closing the model ==
* We still have 2 unknowns for 1 equation.
* We introduce 1 more unknown: $M$, the number of firms.
* We then use 2 market clearings: domestic and foreign.

== Export demand ==
* For the marginal exporter,
\[
\pi_x(\varphi^*_x) = 0.
\]
* But we can actually use ''export demand'' to express its profits:
\[
(1-\rho)A \rho^{\theta-1} \tau^{-\theta}\varphi^*_x{}^{\theta-1} = f_x.
\]
* This pins down the cutoff as
\[
\varphi^*_x{} = \left(\frac{f_x}{(1-\rho)A}\right)^{1/(\theta-1)} \frac{\tau}{\rho}.
\]
    * This is increasing $\tau$,
    * decreasing in $A$.

== Domestic cutoff ==
* The domestic cutoff is then
    * decreasing $\tau$,
    * increasing in $A$.

== Labor demand ==
* Because ''in expectation'' firms make zero profit,
\[
 L = R_d+R_x.
\]
* Total revenues are average times number of firms:
\[
 L = R_d+R_x = Mr_d(\tilde\varphi)+M_xr_x(\tilde\varphi_x)
\]
* Conditional on the total number of firms, the number of exporters:
\[
\frac{M_x}{M} = \frac{1-G(\varphi^*_x)}{1-G(\varphi^*)}.
\]
* The labor market clearing then pins down $M$.

== The three effects ==
In the event of a trade liberalization (falling trade costs),
1. more firms will export ("extensive margin"),
2. labor is reallocated from less productive non-exporters to more productive exporters,
3. and least productive non-exporters will exit. 
...
We conduct comparative statics wrt $\tau$.

== Extensive margin ==
* The fraction of exporters $M_x/M$ is decreasing in the export cutoff.
* Recall that export cutoff,
\[
\varphi^*_x{} = \left(\frac{f_x}{(1-\rho)A}\right)^{1/(\theta-1)} \frac{\tau}{\rho},
\]
is increasing in $\tau$.
* Hence $M_x/M$ increases with trade liberalization.

== Labor reallocation ==
* A constant $\rho$ fraction of revenue goes to labor:
\[
l(\varphi) = \rho r(\varphi).
\]
* Relative employment for an exporter and a non-exporter:
\[
\frac{l(\varphi|\varphi>\varphi^*_x)}{l(\varphi'|\varphi'<\varphi^*_x)} = 
\frac{r_d(\varphi)+r_x(\varphi)}{r_d(\varphi')} = 
\left(\frac{\varphi}{\varphi'}\right)^{\theta-1}
\frac{A \rho^{\theta-1} \tau^{-\theta} + \frac{R_d}{M}\tilde\varphi^{1-\theta}}{\frac{R_d}{M}\tilde\varphi^{1-\theta}}
\]
* This is clearly ''decreasing'' in $\tau$.
* After trade liberalization, exporters expand relative to non-exporters.

== Exit ==
* As discussed before, export profit opportunities generate more entry.
* New entrants squeeze out less productive firms.
